# Logic and Law

Formal logic has been acknowledged as an indispensable tool in creating, understanding, reasoning, and arguing about law, but also [dismissed](https://books.google.ro/books?id=bVxRToF92awC&pg=PA11) as unable to produce normative judgements (telling us what to do) or decide how to weigh arguments.

The truth: It is not only possible to express law and arguments in a formal language, but desirable and beneficial to do so in order to achieve a just and efficient society.


## Natural and/or Formal Languages

The key distinction between natural (human) and formal (logical) languages is *decidability*. It is almost always possible to interpret an english sentence in different, even contradictory ways, depending on not only the actual sentence and words in it, but also context in the broadest sense, and the intentions we imagine the author to have had. That's great for poetry, but bad for justice. After all, how can one obey the law if it is impossible, even in principle, to be sure what it means?

Suitable formal languages on the other hand guarantee, by construction, the consistency of sentences, and the validity of arguments. It is always possible to tell wether a sentence makes sense, and what it means. It is always possible to decide wether an argument is valid, if it contains errors and what they are, and wether it even proves the right thing.

Here's a great analogy: digital vs analog media. A computer audio file can be perfectly copied (without having to be played), and two people can apply the same transformations (eg. effects or compression) on different computers and get identical results. Also, it is always possible to compare two files to determine with complete certainty wether they are exactly the same, and if not, what the exact difference is. These things are not possible with vinyl records. It is no wonder that vinyls are used purely for aesthetic or nostalgic reasons. In all functional aspects, digital media are superior and have replaced analog.

We can indeed say that natural language laws, regulations, and legal arguments are more open to interpretation, interesting, beautiful, serious, humanly flawed, well-written, hopeful, and so on. But formalized law is clear, decidable, reasonable, understandable, _knowable_. Through the study of what knowledge, meaning, and argument are, we come up with a language where these things are explicit, computable, and the same for everyone. After overcoming inertia and conflicts of interest, formalized law will surely replace legal prose and free-form argument, just as DVDs have replaced VHS.


## The Power of Logic

Logic is the study of language, meaning, argumentation, and knowledge. It informs us about the ways we can answer questions of the form "If we know `p`, do we know `q`?". This subject has been studied for thousands of years, with success: humanity has developed a rich set of tools to answer such questions and in the process learned about knowledge and the underlying nature of causality and information itself.

Logic has allowed us to analyze and understand everything from physics to computer circuits and programs to [metaphysics](http://mally.stanford.edu/cm/). A classic example in law is [the british nationality act as a logic program](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/p370-sergot.pdf).

To recognize the power of logic, we will look at the limits of logic.


### Consistency and Completeness

[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) prove that it is impossible for a complex logical system to be both consistent (containing no contradictions) and complete (being able to prove all sentences either true or false), loosely, by studying paradoxes such as "This sentence is false". Usually we opt for maintaining consistency, which means there are some things we just can't prove. This is not a weakness of logic, but a strong result about knowledge, proof, and information, and far from denying us the fruits of reason, instead shows us how to build meaningful logical systems (ones that allow proof of the most possible sentences without compromising consistency) and good arguments. Also, deciding wether a given sentence is meaningful (grammatically correct) and what it means, is a different question, and always possible in most logics.


### The Halting Problem

[Logic and programming are the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence). The short and salient version is, computer programs crash or freeze preciesely when they contain logical inconsistencies or paradoxes, ie. "don't make sense". Conversely, we can rule these out with complete certainty, as well as ensure correctness of programs, by way of logical proof.

Alan Turing [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) that there is no general algorithm to decide, for all possible programs, wether the program will run to completion in finite time (halt, produce a result) or wether it will run forever without making any progress (freeze).

Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean that any computation might run forever, we just can't tell, and there's no point in trying. Instead, we learned _how_ to prove that programs terminate for all inputs, and built programming languages that rule out freezes. These are called "total" languages, as opposed partial languages, in which programs might get stuck for some inputs.


### Deontic Logic

Logic alone can't tell us what we should do. As David Hume always said, you can't derive an "ought" from an "is". That means, just looking at the how the world *is*, no amount of logic will tell us how it *ought* to be or what we *should* do. But once we decide what we want, logic and science _will_ tell us what we should do to achieve it.

Deontic logic studies "should".

### Bunk

Logic can not possibly capture the complexity of human thought, law, or everyday life. That is because it does not make sense. We try to make sense of it all the time, limited by cognitive biases, but we haven't thought it _all_ through. No one has. It is impossible for any one person. The totality of human language, thought and knowledge is a patchwork of overlapping meanings, like a bag of random puzzle pieces. The more of them you put together, the less the whole thing will fit.

We can't think it all through. But we can formalize a great deal, and compute with its entirety. As an example, autopilots in passenger airlines have, throughout decades, carried billions safely to their destination, increased safety, compliance and efficiency and reduced cost.

An autopilot is a logic program. Inputs are regulations, maps, physical characteristics of the plane, sensors, GPS, weather, radar, pilot commands. The ouputs are the flight controls. Autopilots avoid no-fly zones, respect speed and altitude limits, as well as solve physics equations to find efficient flight paths (in terms of fuel and time), all in real time.

This is a complete knowledge system, illustrating the success of formal methods brilliantly. It's so successful that we forget it's there, which is the ultimate goal of technology. So why don't we put our taxes on autopilot? The sensational and deadly nature of aviation accidents was a great motivating factor in developing this technology, contributing to the unprecedented safety found in air transportation. Other aspects of humanity have not been so (un)lucky.

[Court costs](http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/resource/us-legal-system-is-worlds-most-costly-according-to-a-new-study) are another example. There is ample room to reduce costs, increase efficiency and more importantly, the precision of the courts.

Worldwide, [road accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision) cause 50 million injuries and more than one million deaths each year. Over 90% of accidents can be partly or wholly attributed to human factors. Self-driving cars will bring some of the safety of air travel to cars in the decades to come.


## Conflict of Interest

The conflict between precision and conciseness is inherent in language, and especially problematic when that language is meant to tell us what to do and the punishment if we don't. More interesting and avoidable are the conflicts of the people involved in law.


### The Conflict of the Lawyer

The job of attorneys is to win the case. In the argument they bring forward, the facts are irrelevant (but complicate things through evidence).

Still, arguments should make sense, and logic is the way to ensure that. Lawyers, more so than judges, have incentives to misrepresent the letter of the law. Ambiguous language is prime target for clever redefinitions, alternative interpretations, even going so far as to [deny](https://books.google.ro/books?id=_4OPYtXwLtwC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA49) de Morgan's laws while claiming to know what the authors intended better than the text itself. If we can't agree on what "or" means, how can laws ever be just?


### The Conflict of the Judge

Judges are people too. They have interests, beliefs, opinions, party affiliations, [etc](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3293&context=flr).


### The Conflict of the Legislator

The people making our laws should disclose and divest of concerns that incentivize them to act against our benefit. That's just not what happens in practice. There are many reasons not to enact just, concise laws, and to encourage loopholes, ambiguity, inconsistency, as well as convoluted language to hide them.

A great example is the U.K. tax code, now 21602 pages and over a million words in length, up from a few hundred pages back in 1965. It is designed to foster an entire industry of tax "counseling", accessible only to the rich. It is an intentional mess of complexity that creates an endless amount of "work" exploiting tax loopholes to the detriment of the state and the rest of society.

Incidentally, tax law is also the most well suited candidate for formalization, especially in light of the strong link between logic and computation. A formalized tax law would not only be free of contradiction and ambiguity, it would also _do your taxes for you_. As a logical theorem and proof, it is also, equivalently, a program that calculates your taxes. If there are multiple possibilities, it will find the minimum amount.

Public choice theory - democracy leads to bad choices.

The legistlator's conflict is hardest and most important to overcome.
